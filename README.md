# ProbaR

A simple copy/implementation of 
[RSpec](https://rspec.info)
with rather reduced functionality.

## Installation

### Requirements

requires rake

## Usage

In order to run the tests call:
```
$rake
```

As of writing it is possible to use
```
expect(a).to eq b
```
which will return true or false accordling
and `it` blocks are currently halfway implemented but do not
work directly with `expect`.
